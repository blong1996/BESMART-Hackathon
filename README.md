## The Hackathon:

We were tasked with building an in-car infotainment application in under 36 hours. We had to be sure that
the application used the Ionic Framework and utilized the following APIs: UserApp, IDScan, Plot Projects, 
and Stripe. The event took place in San Francisco, CA October 2016.

## Our Concept:

*Let’s Go Black!* is an iOS application that helps discover a customized road trip adventure exploring 
Black history and culture, while supporting Black owned small businesses along the way. The app allows 
users to input parameters of the trip (i.e. theme, distance and starting location), then randomly 
generates a road trip with specially curated stops that are African American inspired attractions and 
landmarks. Additionally, the app alerts users when they are within the vicinity of Black owned small 
businesses, who are members of the *Let’s Go Black!* platform.
